# Krutaka

An OpenClaw-inspired AI agent built in C#/.NET 10 for Windows, powered by the Claude API. Krutaka is a local-first, security-hardened console agent that can read, write, search, and execute commands in your project — with human-in-the-loop approval for all destructive operations.

> **Status:** ✅ v0.1.0 — Fully implemented and tested. 576 tests passing, ready for use. See [Progress Tracker](docs/status/PROGRESS.md).

## Why Krutaka?

OpenClaw demonstrated the power of agentic AI — and also its dangers. CVE-2026-25253 (RCE via exposed API), CVE-2026-25157 (command injection), and CVE-2026-24763 (sandbox escape) showed that security must be designed in from day one, not bolted on later.

Krutaka is built to avoid those mistakes:

- **No network listener** — Console-only, no HTTP/WebSocket surface. Eliminates the entire CVE-2026-25253 attack class.
- **DPAPI-encrypted secrets** — API keys stored in Windows Credential Manager, never in files or environment variables.
- **Mandatory human approval** — Write and execute operations require explicit user confirmation.
- **Command allowlisting** — Shell execution uses a strict allowlist enforced in code, not config.
- **Path sandboxing** — All file operations are jailed to the project directory with canonicalization and blocklists.
- **Prompt injection defense** — Untrusted content (file contents, command output) is tagged with XML delimiters and the model is instructed to treat it as data only.

## Key Technology Choices

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | .NET 10 LTS | Supported until Nov 2028. No support cliff pressure. |
| Claude SDK | Official `Anthropic` v12.4.0 (GA) | Vendor-backed, stable, streaming + tool use support. |
| Console UI | Spectre.Console 0.54.0 | Rich markup, panels, spinners, prompts. .NET Foundation project. |
| Database | SQLite via Microsoft.Data.Sqlite | FTS5 built-in, zero-config, local-only. |
| Process execution | CliWrap | Safe async execution, no string interpolation, argument arrays. |
| Secrets | Windows Credential Manager | DPAPI-backed encryption at rest. |
| Logging | Serilog | Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs. |

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 22H2+ or Windows 11 (x64)
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- Claude API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chethandvg/krutaka.git
cd krutaka

# Build
dotnet build

# Run (first run will prompt for API key)
dotnet run --project src/Krutaka.Console

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Publish self-contained binary
dotnet publish src/Krutaka.Console -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

## Security Posture

Krutaka implements defense-in-depth security controls to prevent the vulnerabilities found in OpenClaw:

### Implemented Security Controls

| Control | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Secrets Management** | Windows Credential Manager with DPAPI encryption | ⚠️ Partially Complete |
| **Command Allowlist** | Hardcoded allowlist/blocklist in `CommandPolicy` | ✅ Complete |
| **Path Validation** | Canonical path resolution + project root sandboxing | ✅ Complete |
| **Process Sandboxing** | Windows Job Objects (256MB memory, 30s CPU limits) | ✅ Complete |
| **Human Approval** | Blocking approval for write/execute operations | ✅ Complete |
| **Environment Scrubbing** | Remove API keys/secrets from child processes | ✅ Complete |
| **Log Redaction** | Automatic API key scrubbing from all log output | ✅ Complete |
| **Prompt Injection Defense** | Untrusted content wrapped in XML tags | 📋 Documented (implementation pending) |
| **Audit Logging** | Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs | ✅ Complete |

### Security Test Coverage

- **125 security policy tests** covering:
  - 40 command validation tests (allowlist, blocklist, metacharacters)
  - 40 path validation tests (traversal, blocked directories, file patterns)
  - 20 environment scrubbing tests
  - 25+ attack vector simulations
- **All security tests passing** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Separate security test workflow** for critical security validations

### Threat Model

Krutaka addresses the following threats identified in OpenClaw CVEs:

| Threat | OpenClaw CVE | Mitigation | Validation |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

### Before Contributing

1. **Read the architecture documentation:**
   - [docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md](docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md) — Component structure
   - [docs/architecture/SECURITY.md](docs/architecture/SECURITY.md) — Security model
   - [docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md](docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md) — Design rationale
   - [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — Agent instructions and coding standards

2. **Understand the security rules** (see [docs/architecture/SECURITY.md](docs/architecture/SECURITY.md)):
   - Never hardcode secrets
   - Always validate paths through `IFileOperations.ValidatePath()`
   - Always validate commands through `CommandPolicy.ValidateCommand()`
   - Use CliWrap with explicit argument arrays (never string interpolation)
   - Wrap untrusted content in `<untrusted_content>` tags

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/chethandvg/krutaka.git
cd krutaka
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Format code
dotnet format
```

### Coding Standards

- **Target:** .NET 10, C# 13 (`LangVersion latest`)
- **Nullable reference types:** Enabled globally
- **Warnings as errors:** All warnings must be resolved
- **Naming:** PascalCase for public, `_camelCase` for private fields
- **Async:** All I/O methods must be async with `CancellationToken`
- See [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for complete conventions

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Write tests** for new functionality (use xUnit + FluentAssertions)
3. **Run security tests:** `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~SecurityPolicy|FullyQualifiedName~SecurityViolationLogging"`
4. **Ensure all tests pass:** `dotnet test`
5. **Format code:** `dotnet format`
6. **Update documentation** if you change architecture or add features
7. **Submit PR** with clear description of changes

### Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainer directly (see GitHub profile)
3. Provide detailed description and reproduction steps
4. Wait for response before public disclosure
